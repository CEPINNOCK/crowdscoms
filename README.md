Introduction

Welcome to the __Bunnies API!__ Bunnies live in rabbit holes, and as a user you can manage rabbit holes and the bunnies that live in them. We also love to capture analytics about our users so we do some basic tracking too.


Instructions:
----

This repository contains a simple Django Rest Framework API project with a couple of apps and models. We've added some
basic views and tests. Essentially we'd like you to fix the project so that the whole test suite passes.

We've setup the project in [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), but there's also a basic [dockerfile](https://www.docker.com/) as well.

1. Import this repository into your personal github account using the github [import](https://github.com/new/import) page (Please **don't** create a fork). (https://github.com/new/import)
2. Clone your imported repository to your local machine
3. Fix the tests
4. Commit changes to your imported repository
5. Send us a link to review!

Please don't spend more than __2 hours__ on this task (not including initial download and setup). If you reach 2 hours, please commit your code as-is and send us what you have.
